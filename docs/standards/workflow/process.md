## Working Process

### One Concern per Step

A step implements one thing, verifies it, reports and stops for the next instruction. Unrelated
fixes are not batched into the same pass, however tempting the detour looks while the file is
already open.

### Problems Are Reported, Not Quietly Fixed

Anything noticed along the way is listed briefly at the end of the message, without hedging, and left
alone. It becomes its own step, and only after the maintainer agrees to it.

### Verify With pnpm validate and pnpm vitest run

Every step is checked with `pnpm validate` (typecheck, lint, format check, build) and
`pnpm vitest run`, and the report says plainly what passed and what did not. CI splits the same work
across separate jobs, but locally these two commands are the whole gate. When something was only
checked statically and
never exercised in a running app, say so in those words. A frontend change is not verified until it
has been opened in a browser.

### What Green Means Here

CI runs four jobs. Three of them run in parallel, each on its own runner, each repeating checkout,
Node, pnpm and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` before doing its own work: `lint` runs `pnpm lint`
and `pnpm format:check`, `build` runs `pnpm build`, and `test` runs `pnpm vitest run`. The fourth,
`deploy-api`, waits on all three. The workflow also declares a `pull_request` trigger, which never
fires, because this repository does not use pull requests.

There is no separate typecheck job, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight. `pnpm build`
runs `tsc -b` in the API and the web app, and TypeScript project references make that walk into
`domain` and `schemas` as well, so the build already typechecks every package. A typecheck job would
compile the same code a second time.

The `test` job generates the Prisma client itself before running Vitest. Its runner is a fresh
machine that has never run a build, and `createApp` imports `@prisma/client` through the repository
layer, so without that step the suite fails on an ungenerated client.

So CI reports on code that is already on `main`. It catches what a machine other than this one sees,
which is worth having, but it is a net rather than a gate. Splitting one job into four makes a
failure easier to read and lets a single job be rerun, but it does not turn CI into a gate. The gate
is running `pnpm validate` and `pnpm vitest run` locally, before the commit.

`deploy-api` runs `flyctl deploy --remote-only` after `lint`, `build` and `test` all pass, and only
on a push to `main`. It exists because Vercel redeploys the front end on every push while Fly.io does
not. A single `deploy-api` concurrency group keeps two deploys from running the migration release
command at the same time.

Two things are worth knowing about. No CI job runs `pnpm validate` itself, it runs the pieces, so the
local command and the remote checks can drift apart if one is changed without the other. And the
build is a compile check, not a rehearsal of the real one: neither the CI runner nor a bare checkout
has a `VITE_API_URL`, so the bundle it produces is thrown away and only Vercel's build makes a bundle
that runs. `validate` also writes to `dist/`, which no other check does.

### The Toolchain Version Lives in Three Places

Node 24 is pinned in `engines.node`, in the CI `setup-node` step and in the API `Dockerfile`; pnpm
9.0.0 comes from the `packageManager` field and is read by both CI and the Docker build. Changing the
version means changing all of them together.

### CI Has No Database

The `build` and `test` jobs set a deliberately unusable `DATABASE_URL`, purely so `prisma generate`
can run. There are no service containers and no secrets in either of them, so every test must be pure
or take its collaborators by injection. The one secret the workflow uses, `FLY_API_TOKEN`, belongs to
`deploy-api` and never reaches a test.

### Read the Decision Log Before Touching the Foundations

`docs/decisions.md` records why the architecture is what it is, and what each choice costs. Read it
before changing package wiring, authentication or how offers are persisted, so that a change is made
deliberately rather than by accident.
